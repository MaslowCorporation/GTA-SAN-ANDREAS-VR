### The list of mods that improve the game experience

### TODO

- [ ] utilise joy2key ou similaire pour set in car:
L2 as brake/reverse
R2 as accelerate, 
L1 as handbrake

tip: In <root>/GInputSA.ini change ControlsSet=1 to ControlsSet=2.


in the game settings

- [ ] utilise joy2key ou similaire pour set on foot:

set L2 as aim 
set R2 as shoot, 

in the game settings

- [ ] Install vjoy

- [ ] Test steam-uevr-wheel inside GTA San Andreas vorpx

- [ ] Import all socket related code from

C:\Users\MaslowPatrick\Desktop\MaslowWorld\VRHands\VRHands\dllmain.cpp

to

C:\plugin-sdk\tools\myplugin-gen\generated\gta_wheel\source\Main.cpp
or rather
C:\plugin-sdk\tools\myplugin-gen\generated\gta_wheel\source\gta_wheel.sln

- [ ] fix errors and make successful build

- [ ] on plugin initialization, turn the socket server on and print the value of the steering wheel angle to the game and log it to the console or in game.
WinDBG may help.

- [ ] on plugin death, turn the socket server off.

- [ ] First dummy algorithm for the steering wheel:

Apply the angle value from the socket server as is, to the in game steering angle.

- [ ] Second better algorithm for the steering wheel:

apply a steering ratio to the steering wheel angle.

(A steering ratio of x:y means that a turn of the steering wheel x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1.)

See https://chatgpt.com/c/6806a763-0f34-8012-9073-764a45ede404

- [ ] another better algorithm for the steering wheel (smoothing):

See https://chatgpt.com/c/68069bdd-87e4-8012-a86c-dd9caf483748 
for inspiration.

- [ ] implemente keyboard press handler

- [ ] implemente gamepad press handler

- [ ] when R1 is pressed, and you're sitting in a car, toggle the steam-uevr-wheel
between invisible, setup mode, and game mode. (edit config.json)

- [] Set L2 to brake/reverse and R2 to accelerate, in the game settings

- [ ] Make CJ invisible when sitting in a car. either via plugin-sdk or cleo / sannybuilder

- [] reposition the HUD elements  to the center of the screen , using

https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andreas/tools/18704-inteface-editor-visual.html

- [] Try to use the SendInput c++ function, or plugin-sdk, or etc...to send input to press the V key twice, to toggle the first person view, when the game starts, and CJ is playable. If it doesn't work, simply move on. Do not spend time on this.

- [ ] set edgepeek distance from screen up

- [ ] try to fix the resolution issue of the game.
(2880 x 2160 x 32 should be the native resolution of the game)

- [] Add mods to the game
